	<p class="narrator" style="font-size:2em; text-align:center">Well, hello there.</p>
	<p class="narrator">If you're here, then this is probably either your first time here, or you're a bit lost and in need of some help.</p>
	<p class="narrator">It's completely fine, in fact you'll come to learn that as long as you're here with us, ignorance is a blessing more than it is a curse.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="narrator">I am a narrator of this humble story, made with (a lot) of inspiration from great pieces of writing such as Vast Error and Homestuck.</p>
	<p class="narrator">Well I do have a name, but maybe you don't want to know about that just yet.</p>
	<p class="narrator">This story is exactly what it reads up there. Yes, up there. The banner at the top of the screen. Although it might not seem like it at first, this is indeed a story about a bunch of kids, finding themselves amid a lost world.</p>
	<p class="narrator">You ought to prepare yourself, especially if you haven't read the likes of Homestuck. We have at least 16 characters, 5 whole acts and a hefty amount of worldbuilding and lore. But I promise if you stick around for the ride, the payout will be absolutely gratifying.</p>
	<p class="narrator">So read on, dear reader. Live, laugh and love along with the characters. Feel their joy, their pain, their catharsis.</p>
	<p class="narrator">Have a little fun while you're at it, too. I'm not judging.</p>
	<p class="narrator">Your viewing is much appreciated. After all, what is a narrator without their audience?</p>
	<br>
	<p class="narrator">Well, I've got to go, reader. Goodbye, and thank you so much for reading and making it this far through my wordy tirade. Have a good time here, won't you?</p>
	<p class="narrator">And yes, there are some <a href="secrets.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: #ffffe0">secrets</a> along the way too.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="narrator">I'll be seeing you around.</p>
