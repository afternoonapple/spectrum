	<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: ……And that’s it!</p>
	<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: Segment 1 is done!</p>
	<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: Wait, but it says at the end of the page…</p>
	<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: “Demonstrate your species abilities.”</p>
	<p class="cassiopeia">CASSIOPEIA: seriously.</p>
	<p class="zenith">ZENITH: Well guys, even if we were willing to do that I don’t think we’d have the time.</p>
	<p class="zenith">ZENITH: Look at the message board.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="narrator">He’s right. Another message pops up on the notice board.</p>
	<p class="announcement"><u>You guys are in for something special today. Assemble at the school foyer in 10 minutes and bring your things with you.</u></p>
	<br>
	<p class="aurora">AURORA: Seriously, there’s no time for species stuff now.</p>
	<p class="aurora">AURORA: Someone download the file and we’ll go through it later or tomorrow or something.</p>
	<p class="atom">ATOM: I guess I can do that.</p>
	<p class="aurora">AURORA: Thanks, man.</p>
	<p class="aurora">AURORA: I guess while Atom does that…</p>
	<p class="aurora">AURORA: The room is sufficiently lit…</p>
	<p class="aurora">AURORA: Ghosts, shall we?</p>
	<br>
	<p class="narrator">Moran, Aurora and Candell get into their ghost forms, leaving their bodies slumped on their chairs.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: Woah</p>
	<p class="moran">MORAN: doesn’t hurt to get a real-life demonstration once in a while</p>
	<p class="candell">CANDELL: Anyone tried possession before?</p>
	<p class="aurora">AURORA: I did it once before, but it was sort of half-accidental?</p>
	<p class="candell">CANDELL: Okay, anyone want to try right now?</p>
	<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: woah there</p>
	<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: i dont think were ready enough for that man</p>
	<p class="candell">CANDELL: Well I’ve tried it a few times with Ferr.</p>
	<p class="candell">CANDELL: Some were actually successful.</p>
	<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: I don’t think they’d be quite comfortable though, Dell.</p>
	<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: You should know by now when both parties aren’t completely willing, it doesn’t work.</p>
	<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: right now we gotta go over to the school foyer though</p>
	<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: taking orders from creepy text on a screen.</p>
	<p class="cassiopeia">CASSIOPEIA: i’m sure there will be plenty of opportunities for us to demonstrate our species-specific abilities over the course of these 4 years!</p>
	<p class="cassiopeia">CASSIOPEIA: so actually, there’s no need to do anything weird now.</p>
	<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: yeah exactly.</p>
	<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: so we should probably proceed to the foyer first.</p>
	<p class="aurora">AURORA: Haha, yeah.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="narrator">The 3 ghosts get back into their physical forms. Everybody packs up and leaves the classroom, now talking incessantly.</p>
	<p class="narrator">Little do they know though, they won’t see this classroom again anytime soon.</p>
