<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: “Segment II: Classifications”.</p>
<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: “With excerpts taken from BEHAVIOURALYSIS, by DENIDUO XXXXXXX and RESCIPI XXXXXXX circa 1717.”</p>
<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: Damn that’s pretty old isn’t it.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: it’ll have been about 900 years now yeah</p>
<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: I still don’t get why they X out the surnames on everything published pre-Reform. Like, they didn’t want the authors to get too much credit or something?</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: oh, i actually read this up a few weeks ago. there’s a very interesting answer</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: why did you even bother to search this kind of thing lol</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: eh i was bored.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: anyway since the whole point of the Reform was to establish equality across the blood colour spectrum</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: (you should already have known that from middle school history classes)</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: names of authors of journals, papers, fiction books, basically all forms of written literature had their colour-revealing surnames crossed out by their own hands post-Reform. </p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: the whole point of the movement was not only to preserve anonymity and stop discrimination but also to start getting readers to regard books by their content and not by their writer</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: which although discards the importance of the writer to some degree also made more sense in a world wracked with so much prejudice.</p>
<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: Damn.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: shit that was a really badass way to rebel against the system.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Yes it was.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: But before this guy here geeks out too hard let’s continue.</p>
