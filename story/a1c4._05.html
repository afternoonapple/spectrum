<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Your magical power grows steadily from birth until the onset of puberty, which causes your growth rate to generally increase and maybe even spike.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: As you do so, you enter into the different tiers of power.</p>
<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: oh so it’s like a progressive stage thing</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Yes, it is.</p>

<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: As you are now, you are all at the first tier: it’s called Alpha.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: (But usually all the actual tier names are in Greek and sound awful, so we like to call them by their roman numeral instead.)</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: As you become more powerful in the months and years to come, you’ll slowly climb the tiers. Your body will feel a tremendous ache, and when it runs its course a day or two later, you’ll know when you’ve reached the next tier.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Each tier will boost your powers significantly, and even more after my machine is successful.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: However, this cannot be done without hardship. Each tier requires more effort and suffering than the last.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Eventually you’ll reach the fourth tier, called Sigma.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: The final tier, or Omega tier as it’s formally called, is a farther boost in power than any other by a longshot.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: The thing is…</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Uhh, actually it’s quite complicated. It’ll take a while to sink in for those who don’t yet quite understand.</p>
<br>
<p class="narrator">The kids just nod, intrigued by what lies ahead of them. Some of them are excited that they were more special than they had thought. Others fawn over the capabilities of the machine.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Anyway, I wanted to do an experiment on something else.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Everyone, put on these earpieces. We’re going somewhere pretty far away.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Where are we going exactly?</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Some old places.</p>
