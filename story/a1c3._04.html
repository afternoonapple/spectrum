<p class="narrator">The aspect of SPACE controls the physical position and of things, allowing for powers such as telekinesis, teleportation and portal creation.</p>
<p class="narrator">“Space-bearers are masters of social situations. They love physical exploration, and discovering new areas and personalities. Just the right amount of distance is key to ensuring a good relationship with them, and this is something they are keenly aware of and are naturally good at manipulating. They will usually be the first to attempt to break an awkward barrier in their conversations. However, this extremely clear awareness of their social boundaries can make space-bearers seem a little sensitive to some. They will know the second they have transgressed, or if they have been transgressed on. As such, they can get caught up in emphasising their ideals of loyalty and trust by over-applying them to their relationships. At their best, space-bearers are sociable, bold and understanding. At their worst, they are cold, distant or difficult.”</p>
