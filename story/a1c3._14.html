<p class="narrator">Lastly, the aspect of LIGHT deals with light energy, although being able to shape it into a much more concentrated and intense beam. Competent users of this aspect can even steal the light from a place, making it darker!</p>
<p class="narrator">“Light-bearers are relentless truth-seekers. They have an innate desire for knowledge, and will stop at almost nothing to get the answers they seek. They are the type of people who would play a video game or watch a movie another time over just to get a few more details out. To light-bearers, nothing is ever off-limits. However, this pursuit for clarity ironically makes their sense of self unclear: their dedication to the truth is so strong that they may forgo their friends, their health and even their own moral compass in order to achieve it. Thus, light-bearers tend to face a moral dilemma between their conquest for objectivity and their own humanity. They are usually quick-witted, curious and humorous. But when gripped by the truth, they can appear ruthless, demanding or aggressive.”</p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: No running away from this one, Dell.</p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: You’re a light major.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Could we like… not do this?</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: It’s technically still optional.</p>
<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: but where’s the fun in that?</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Well, anyone else a light major? By any chance?</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: (Please save me)</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: Oh actually, I’m a light major too.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Oh thank god.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Would you mind showing some light powers? I’m not really feeling up to it today… </p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: He’s giving excuses.</p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: You got anything, Aurora?</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: Not that I don’t, but… </p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: A lot of my light magic is combat-oriented.</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: I’m not sure if we can even use that kind of magic in settings such as this… </p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: Awww. Could you explain what you can do, then?</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: Oh, I’d be happy to.</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: …So one of my favourites is a beam attack.</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: The concept is simple, really. You conceal light within a small sphere so it keeps bouncing around inside and increasing in intensity.</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: Then when it’s done “charging” you open a hole and let it blast out.</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: So it’s something like a laser</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: Well if you put it that way… it sounds more like a cheap 23rd century film gimmick.</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: But yeah. A laser.</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: I’m honestly surprised why they don’t teach us a similar offensive maneuver in middle school. It’s not too difficult to do once you get a hold of it.</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: Hmm, now that gets me a little interested</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: How effective are those beams?</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: Well… I’ve blown holes in walls trying to practice before.</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: drywall or</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: I don’t know, man. Pretty sure there was concrete in there.</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: oh dang </p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: Wow. I’ve never thought to use Light that way</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: It’s only my minor aspect, but I’ve got to say that is impressive</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: Hehe, thanks! </p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: Still not a very good idea to try here, though.</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: Understandable</p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: Heheh, that sounds pretty darn amazing.</p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: My pal over here doesn’t have anything like that.</p>
<p class="narrator">She lands an obnoxious slap on Candell’s back. Again.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Oh come on. You make it sound like my attacks are weeny.</p>
<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: well are they</p>
<p class="narrator">He facepalms.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: What would you do if I said yes?</p>
<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: i have no idea</p>
<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: laugh??</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: I’m sure Candell is great too.</p>
<p class="aurora">AURORA: (I hope.)</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Uh huh. Yes I am.</p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: Uh huh, sure you are.</p>
