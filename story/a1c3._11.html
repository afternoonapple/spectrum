<p class="narrator">The aspect of SOUL controls and reads the emotions of others, thus having an indirect (but powerful) influence on another’s actions.</p>
<p class="narrator">“Soul-bearers are usually an unbridled source of positivity and optimism. Their literal and metaphorical aura flows from them in a way that is hard to ignore. If there's some cheering up to be done, you can count on a soul-bearer and their unbreakable upbeat attitude to keep everyone in good spirits. However, they are emotionally fragile. Soul-bearers are the best at manipulating others' emotions, but ironically are the ones who have the least control over their own. A lot of what they do can be on an impulse, affected largely by their emotions. They feel their desires, and simply act on them. Soul-bearers' wills are some of the most pliable: they might change their minds too quickly for people to catch up with them, or get influenced by an idea that may be controversial or radical. Nonetheless, soul-bearers are usually friendly, confident and empathetic. But they can also seem wild, superficial or greedy.”</p>
