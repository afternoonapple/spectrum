<p class="narrator">And so their lesson begins. The kids take turns to read the text.</p>

<p class="narrator">Aspects are manifestations of a particular section of a sentient’s common genetics which allow them to manipulate real-world entities and objects with pure force of will alone. Every single type of this manipulation can be linked or traced back to the 10 total classified aspects. Each sentient, no matter the species, is gifted with exactly 2 of these, separating into major and minor aspects by the onset of puberty. However it is important to note that humans have these particular genes deactivated, and until recent developments in genetic science within the past century, it has been biologically impossible for humans to use their aspects meaningfully, so as to say, to use magic.</p>
<p class="narrator">In this lesson, we will go through the 10 aspects in brief detail, with additional interesting tidbits pertaining to aspect bearers’ personality. A well-known research study done in the pre-Reform age found significant connections between the aspects of sentients and some of their personality traits. This paper in particular will be quoted in excerpts throughout the lesson, to give intellectual credit.</p>
