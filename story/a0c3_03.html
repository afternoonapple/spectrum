<p class="narrator">A girl bursts through the open classroom door with unnatural speed. She is short, wearing a miniskirt and a shirt with a two-piece design that manages to cover her arms twice but reveal a little of her torso. Probably not the most optimal attire to run in.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Dang, look at her.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: please, the day hasn’t even begun yet. curb your enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="narrator"><span class="galinda">???????</span> takes a few moments to regain her composure (unsuccessfully) and walks right over next to Moran as per the seating arrangement dictates.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: oh, you’re the number 8.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: galinda, did i pronounce that correctly?</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: *huff* Not perfectly, but thats perfectly fine</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Seems like the three of us are seated here together</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Greenblood buddies, eh?</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: greenblood buddies it is.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Eyyy.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: You look like you had trouble getting here?</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Not really, there were a bunch of clues and signs everywhere I could follow</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN:(what.)</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: I was so scared I was gonna be late! I overslept.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Yikes. Well at least you found where you needed to go.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Right</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Has class started yet? </p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: I don’t think so. The computer is on standby mode right now.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: yeah, the 12 of us were just vibing in the classroom</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: 13 with you now, actually.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Thats great! Vibing is definitely something right up my alley</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: hmm, that’s cool. maybe you want to do some self-introduction for us?</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: no pressure given.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Dont worry, no pressure received</p>
<p class="narrator">She looks as if she is on the verge of standing up and delivering an impromptu speech.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Right. As you know, my names Galinda</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: As far as personality goes, Id like to think of myself as an Entertainer</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: wait, you know about the myers-briggs type indicator system?</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Hm? Whats that?</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: mbti.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Oooh, yeah I do! Finally someone else who does</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: niiice</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: I love talking to people, making new friends! Definitely wanna get to know you two, and everyone else here</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: And todays only the beginning! Well be here for the next 4 yea-</p>
<p class="narrator">At that instant, the chime of a school bell is heard. The computer and the connected screen immediately begins to start up, which means they won’t be able to talk for much longer.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: -oh welp.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Guess thats it, haha</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Well looks like we’ve gotta cut our intros short too.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: I’m Arwen and he’s Moran. </p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: pleased to meet you</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Same</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Great to get to know you two. Well talk more later, I guess?</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: When we get the chances.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: We’re sitting together for at least this whole semester, anyway. There’ll be many.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Sure thing, Arwen</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Man Im so excited to start this thing. Lets all have some fun!</p>
<p class="narrator">And with that, the now-familiar sound of the classroom computer finishing its boot process plays over the integrated speaker. The clock reads exactly 8.30am, Monday, September 6 2793. The internal fans start their quiet humming, and the display switches on with a flicker of static, then pure white light.</p>
<p class="narrator">It’s time to begin.</p>
