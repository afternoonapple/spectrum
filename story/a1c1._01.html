<p class="narrator">It is nothing but an early September morning. On this day, but not in particular, nothing but the rustling of freshly wilted leaves signals the start of the next academic year. Children, teenagers and adults alike step out into the streets, embracing the cool temperate air as they make their way to where they gradually rediscover their old routines.</p>
<p class="narrator">Just like everyone else, our 16 young protagonists are embarking on a new segment of their lives. Everything looks to be getting better for them: new school, new friends, new life.</p>
<p class="narrator">Right now, we have the privilege of seeing their first day in Sequoia High School. It looks like a bunch of 16 kids just got to their new class. They were each informed to assemble in their classroom, labelled with a modest ‘1/S’ on the door. S, of course, because although they didn’t realize it then, everyone in their new class was special.</p>

<p class="narrator">At 8.30a.m. sharp, there was a message from the computerized noticeboard in the classroom. Nothing but the familiar picture of a kind old lady, recognizable as the avatar chosen for homeroom period fills the screen, the same old thing she had always done for about 465 years now. After successfully booting up, five words flash on the board for the kids to see:</p>
<p class="announcement"><u>Introduce yourselves to each other.</u></p>
<p class="narrator">Simple enough. Another message was flashed on the board, this time a picture of numbers, each kid assigned to one number. As per the usual getting-to-know-each-other procedure, they arranged themselves in a circle according to their numbers. Two kids weren’t there, though. Late, probably.</p>
