<p class="narrator">The aspect of SOUND controls not just actual sound, but also the vibrations around or through objects, gaining the ability to amplify or to diminish them.</p>
<p class="narrator">“Sound-bearers are the most laidback of all the aspects. They tend to choose the easiest path to follow, even if it ends up not bringing the best results. They love going with the flow, and will usually tend to avoid any confrontation or tense situation by not having many strong-willed opinions on a topic they are not particularly invested in. As such, they can also be natural peacemakers and pacifiers. However, this lack of opinion may also disturb them greatly when their plans are disrupted. An abrupt change may leave a sound-bearer lost and suddenly confused, even upset that they will have to change things around all over again in order to regain a sense of normalcy. Sound-bearers are normally casual, accepting and friendly. But in more turbulent times, they can appear clueless, irritated or even desperate.”</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Anyone willing to show off this time</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: ok now this is something i can get behind</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Youre a sound major?</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: yeah.</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: Me too, actually</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: oh that’s epic</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: although those familiar with the aspect of sound probably know that it’s not exactly the most controllable out there.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: at least in tight spaces anyway.</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: Yes</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: Some would say it’s largely an AOE affair</p>
<p class="narrator">Zenith smirks.</p>
<p class="zenith">ZENITH: Heh</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Nice.</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: So I take it that we will reserve our rights to gloat for another time then</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: perhaps.</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: Perhaps</p>
