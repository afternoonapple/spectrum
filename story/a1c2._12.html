<p class="narrator">Your full name is <span class="samsara">SAMSARA TURQUOISE</span>, and you’re really tired. Of course that is your own doing, but as with all the other questionable life choices you’ve made, you can say that it was ultimately worth it. </p>
<p class="narrator">You would like to think that you have made a conscious effort to UNDERSTAND YOURSELF. You believe that doing so is the first step of many to UNDERSTAND THOSE AROUND YOU, and help them. Not to say that you are obsessed with personality tests, you just find them… intriguing. As you say about a lot of things.</p>
<p class="narrator">For you, writing as a hobby is also a form of SELF-EXPRESSION. Fiction allows people to enter new realms, present alternative pictures, characters and PERSONAL TRANSFORMATIONS. It allows you to become something you could only dream to be. You find it an EMOTIONALLY GRATIFYING experience, and maybe someday you can even turn fiction into facts. </p>
<p class="narrator">But it is only every time you get close to finalising a new writing idea that you realise all its inherent flaws. People may say that it’s just unfortunate, but you personally think the universe is OUT TO SPITE YOU, feeding you metaphorical opium to get you hooked and then confiscating it as if it were playing a cruel joke. That’s why you’ve been stuck on writing your novel for the past year or so now. </p>
<p class="narrator">Anyway you store them up in a repository you created inside your head and you can RETRIEVE them if you ever wanted to. Personally you believe that’s one of the mind aspect bearers’ BEST TRADE SECRETS. </p>
<p class="narrator">You are classified as a CYANBLOOD, under the subshade TURQUOISE. Frankly you’re amazed that you actually went from start to finish on an entire chapter last night, which is pretty damn good by your standards. Maybe after you get more sleep you can bring yourself to show your work to some of these new people in your class. One or two of them seem to have very… intriguing personalities.</p>
