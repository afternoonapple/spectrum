<p class="narrator">The aspect of MATTER controls the physical properties of an object, such as its composition, state or size. However, these changes are usually temporary.</p>
<p class="narrator">“Matter-bearers are inventors of the radical. They excel at changing the status quo and bringing change into reality with their unparalleled idealism. They are great mentors and inspire people to their cause and do their very best. They are the best at leaping into the terrors of the unknown, going where no one has ever gone before. This idealism however can be as much of a harm as it is a benefit. Once an idea captivates a matter-bearer, it can be too hard to change their minds once they set their eyes on seeing it through. They might also act brashly, quick to act but end up taking a longer route than reality requires. When fired up, matter-bearers are courageous, pragmatic and revolutionary. On the other hand, they can seem stubborn, careless or overzealous.”</p>

<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Hmmmmmm</p>
<p class="atom">ATOM: Emulating some other material like steel or granite.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Hmm guess I never really tried. No use for that sort of stuff anyway.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: I guess you’re good at it because you blacksmith stuff or something?</p>
<p class="atom">ATOM: Yeah, figured I’d pick up something outside what elementary school teaches you. Nothing else to do for that matter.</p>
<p class="atom">ATOM: Practical too.</p>
