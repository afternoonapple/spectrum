<p class="moran">?????: yooo you’re here!</p>
<p class="arwen">?????: Hey hey, what’s up!</p>
<p class="narrator">The two boys do a sequence of well-rehearsed handshakes.</p>
<p class="arwen">?????: You’re finally here. Class starts in six minutes, Moran. A bit unlike you to be this tardy, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: nice to meet you too, arwen.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: you would not believe how much trouble i had getting here, the size of this place is unbelievable.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: how did you find your way here so quickly?</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: A map of the school exists, you know.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: you can look at that thing??</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: I’ve seen apparatus schematics twice as hard to decipher. I’m already used to it.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: nice.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: here, there’s a seating arrangement on the wall. we sit together.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Unfortunately for me.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: unfortunately for you indeed.</p>
<p class="narrator">He puts his bag on the floor.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: hmm, i didn’t even know you came to sequoia high.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Huh? Didn’t I send you a Talgram text the evening the school allocations came out?</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: oh my god. you know i never check my talgram account.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Man, you never check your socials. That’s why you don’t have any friends.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: well it takes one to know one</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Fool. At least I read messages.</p>

Inside one of the classrooms… ==>
(names hidden)
MORAN enters the classroom. ARWEN is already inside.


Suddenly… ==>
A girl bursts through the open classroom door with unnatural speed. She is short, wearing a miniskirt and a shirt with a two-piece design that manages to cover her arms twice but reveal a little of her torso. Probably not the most optimal attire to run in.
ARWEN: Dang, look at her.
MORAN: please, the day hasn’t even begun yet. curb your enthusiasm.
GALINDA[hidden] takes a few moments to regain her composure (unsuccessfully) and walks right over next to Moran as per the seating arrangement dictates.
MORAN: oh, you’re the number 8.
MORAN: galinda, did i pronounce that correctly?
GALINDA: *huff* Not perfectly, but thats perfectly fine
GALINDA: Seems like the three of us are seated here together
GALINDA: Greenblood buddies, eh?
MORAN: greenblood buddies it is.
GALINDA: Eyyy.
ARWEN: You look like you had trouble getting here?
GALINDA: Not really, there were a bunch of clues and signs everywhere I could follow
MORAN:(what.)
GALINDA: I was so scared I was gonna be late! I overslept.
ARWEN: Yikes. Well at least you found where you needed to go.
GALINDA: Right
GALINDA: Has class started yet? 
ARWEN: I don’t think so. The computer is on standby mode right now.
MORAN: yeah, the 12 of us were just vibing in the classroom
MORAN: 13 with you now, actually.
GALINDA: Thats great! Vibing is definitely something right up my alley
MORAN: hmm, that’s cool. maybe you want to do some self-introduction for us?
MORAN: no pressure given.
GALINDA: Dont worry, no pressure received
She looks as if she is on the verge of standing up and delivering an impromptu speech.
GALINDA: Right. As you know, my names Galinda
GALINDA: As far as personality goes, Id like to think of myself as an Entertainer
MORAN: wait, you know about the myers-briggs type indicator system?
GALINDA: Hm? Whats that?
MORAN: mbti.
GALINDA: Oooh, yeah I do! Finally someone else who does
MORAN: niiice
GALINDA: I love talking to people, making new friends! Definitely wanna get to know you two, and everyone else here
GALINDA: And todays only the beginning! Well be here for the next 4 yea-
At that instant, the chime of a school bell is heard. The computer and the connected screen immediately begins to start up, which means they won’t be able to talk for much longer.
GALINDA: -oh welp.
GALINDA: Guess thats it, haha
ARWEN: Well looks like we’ve gotta cut our intros short too.
ARWEN: I’m Arwen and he’s Moran. 
MORAN: pleased to meet you
GALINDA: Same
GALINDA: Great to get to know you two. Well talk more later, I guess?
ARWEN: When we get the chances.
ARWEN: We’re sitting together for at least this whole semester, anyway. There’ll be many.
GALINDA: Sure thing, Arwen
GALINDA: Man Im so excited to start this thing. Lets all have some fun!
And with that, the now-familiar sound of the classroom computer finishing its boot process plays over the integrated speaker. The clock reads exactly 8.30am, Monday, September 6 2793. The internal fans start their quiet humming, and the display switches on with a flicker of static, then pure white light.
It’s time to begin.
