<p class="narrator">By now, the mood in the room has lightened up quite a lot. The 8th kid steps into the conversation with a little more confidence than she would’ve otherwise. She speaks with a light, cheerful voice that has some sort of sing-song quality to it.</p>
<p class="galinda">???????: Hi everyone!</p>
<p class="galinda">???????: I guess since its been established that were all outliers…</p>
<p class="narrator">She points to her neck to emphasise two small, green dots.</p>
<p class="narrator">A vampire.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: W-wait, you’re a vampire?</p>
<p class="galinda">???????: Yep!</p>
<p class="narrator">Nexus catches a smile but manages to make it almost invisible. Unfortunately for Arwen, Nexus had already managed to see through his fears.</p>
<p class="narrator">She’s snapped out of the moment by mystery vampire girl.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Im Galinda. Pleased to meet you all</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: You can think of me as an entertainer. I feel Im a fun person and Id hope you think that way too</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: (Hm. Yes.)</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: What was that?</p>
<p class="narrator">Arwen is a little startled.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Huh? Oh, nothing.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: You sure? </p>
<p class="narrator">She leans ever-so-slightly closer to get a more comfortable looking angle.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: You look a little shook over there</p>
<p class="narrator">Unfortunately, Arwen gets even more shook.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: I a-assure you, it’s nothing.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Okay then</p>
<p class="narrator">She shifts her attention to the yellow psychic girl.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Nexus, was it?</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: yeah</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: I have a small question</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: How much of everyones brains did you see?</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: not much</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: mostly it was the powers thing i was looking out for</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: but if you also have something that you don’t really want others to know i probably have some recollection of it somewhere. sorry</p>
<p class="narrator">Nexus feels the stares down her back. Not the most she’d felt before, but it’s there.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Okayyy, kinda suspicious but sure</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: well i could erase it if you guys wanted to.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: You could? Hmm thats interesting</p>
<p class="atom">ATOM: But it depends on how deep into our mental icebergs you managed to get. How much of us you managed to see.</p>
<p class="atom">ATOM: Which requires some mental probing that I am most likely not ready for.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: i’ll second that thought.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: keep it to yourself probably, it’ll help you understand us better </p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: like a welcome gift?</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: a welcome gift you forcibly pried out of our heads, but a welcome gift nonetheless. i think we can still allow that on the grounds of goodwillv
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Im well okay with it</p>
<p class="atom">ATOM: I don’t think I have many secrets to begin with.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: heh. we’ll see about that</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: but well, thanks guys, it means a lot.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: not a problem</p>
<p class="narrator">The others may have let Nexus in on some pieces of information, but she doesn’t really care. For her, the acceptance by her peers is her welcome gift. And she, for the first time in a long time, feels welcomed.</p>
