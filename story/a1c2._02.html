<p class="narrator">Your full name is <span class="zenith">ZENITH AQUAMARINE</span>. You know, the surname is a mouthful, but you couldn’t change it even if you tried. </p>
<p class="narrator">You love to TRAVEL, and have the freedom to explore new places. You’re a rather carefree guy, and live for the EXCITEMENT AND FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN. Your same approach applies to LIFE EVENTS IN GENERAL, part of why you’re so stoked to be in high school. But you don’t really get the chance to travel often, so when people ask you for your hobbies you just deflect the question, because you don’t think you can consider travelling to be a hobby.</p>
<p class="narrator">You have been getting into PHOTOGRAPHY lately, though. If photographs are a way of CAPTURING MOMENTS, then it would create some sort of organization for the places you’ve been, memories you’ve made. You think that in today’s hectic world, good memories must be FROZEN AND PRESERVED while people still have the FREEDOM to make them. Still need to wrap your head around how different lenses work, though. You haven’t learnt everything there is to know just yet.</p>
<p class="narrator">You don’t tell this to people much, but you have been afflicted with CHRONIC ASTHMA from birth. It’s mildly persistent, which means it happens for a few minutes every few days or so, and then you have to limit your physical capabilities or risk an attack. But other than that, it goes undetected, and you hope it stays that way. You hold a firm belief that ILLNESS IS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. It would benefit yourself greatly if you carried around an inhaler in your left coat pocket and didn’t say a word otherwise.</p>
<p class="narrator">You are classified as a CYANBLOOD, under the subshade AQUAMARINE. You’re honestly really pumped up for high school. New class full of fun-looking people, new building layout needing to get used to, new food that you’re about to try right now. You take it all in as you ride the new experiences like a tidal wave, and wait patiently to see what distant shore it leads you towards.</p>
