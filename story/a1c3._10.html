<p class="narrator">The aspect of MIND controls the thoughts and minds of others, from simply reading another’s thoughts to even mind control. These powers resemble that of a psychic’s, so as a neat result, psychics who also happen to have a natural mind aspect are usually more powerful than average.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: hmmmm, i wonder.</p>
<p class="atom">ATOM: A literal flex.</p>
<p class="narrator">“Mind-bearers are, as the name suggests, the most capable thinkers. They are the best people to ask ideas from. For them, there is only 1 best way to do something, and they will spare no expense discarding all alternatives and fighting their way to it with facts and logic. Reason is their standard of operation, and this works for and against them. They are ruthlessly logical, willing to contradict even their closest friends for a discrepancy or an inaccurate assumption: but in this way they can come off as unaware or neglectful, getting so lost in their own thoughts that they might forget what or who they are thinking for. Get on a mind-bearer's good side, and they are wilful, impassioned and idealistic. Other times, they can be negligent, passive or emotionless.”</p>
<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: okay, my turn to be flexing.</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: hello everyone.</p>
<p class="cassiopeia">CASSIOPEIA: woahh</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: i am feeding this dialogue directly into your head.</p>
<p class="psychic nexus">NEXUS: oh you can do this too</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: yeah.</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: it’s only location-based though.</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: if you move far enough away, i probably can’t get to you anymore.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Oh my god not this again.</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: what do you mean?</p>
<p class="psychic nexus">NEXUS: oh we were trying to use this to communicate in the library just now hehe</p>
<p class="psychic atom">ATOM: Oh that’s a pretty good use. Unfortunately I haven’t gone to a library in 4 months.</p>
<p class="psychic nexus">NEXUS: anyway i tried to help adelphi and kranyon learn this stuff</p>
<p class="psychic nexus">NEXUS: adelphi got it sort of but kranyon no dice</p>
<p class="psychic zenith">ZENITH: Lmao</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Well I’m still here in this room.</p>
<p class="cassiopeia">CASSIOPEIA: you can teach all of us how to do that?</p>
<p class="psychic nexus">NEXUS: it comes to some easier than others</p>
<p class="psychic nexus">NEXUS: usually with enough time and/or practice it works out but it can be quite frustrating at the start to learn how to project your voice</p>
<p class="psychic adelphi">ADELPHI: AM I STILL BEING LOUD? OR HAVE I GOTTEN THE HANG OF IT.</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: it’s still pretty bad, not gonna lie.</p>
<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: Heh, guess it’s back to regular talking for now then.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Wow, imagine using regular talking. Everyone loves mind powers.</p>
<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: but aren’t you a mind major?</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Wait how did you know-</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Nevermind.</p>
<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: heheh.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: I never learnt how to do this sort of thing, funny enough.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: I never really had to.</p>
<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: you never experimented? like on your own?</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: No, I focused on trying to move things with my head instead.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: My mind vision has always been… sorta cloudy.</p>
<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: and you never wondered why that was the case.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Nah. Some questions just can’t be answered, I guess.</p>
<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: but that’s because you’ve only been thinking about these questions by yourself.</p>
<p class="narrator">She puts two fingers to her head, seemingly getting ready to do something. </p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: ive got a loooot of experience solving this kind of shit, believe me.</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: let me see what i can do about it.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Wait what are you gonna d- AH</p>
	<br>

<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: oh sheesh</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: DAMN that hurt.</p>
<p class="psychic kranyon">KRANYON: What the hell did you do to my neurons??</p>
<p class="psychic nexus">NEXUS: hold on did you just</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Wait.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Huh.</p>
<p class="psychic kranyon">KRANYON: Guess I did.</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: there we go ladies and gentlemen, problem solved.</p>
<p class="cassiopeia">CASSIOPEIA: woohoo</p>
<p class="psychic nexus">NEXUS: wait but what did you do to him?</p>
<p class="psychic nexus">NEXUS: i still don’t get how you did it</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: oh i just sent a pulse through his brain to activate all of his neurons at the same time.</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: figured there was a mental block somewhere.</p>
<p class="psychic nexus">NEXUS: but wouldn’t that have killed him?</p>
<p class="psychic kranyon">KRANYON: What the heck.</p>
<p class="psychic samsara">SAMSARA: not if the voltage is small enough.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Well it still hurt a lot.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: But I think the pain is… much better now?</p>
<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: you’re welcome.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Wow. Guess I know who to call up for mental block issues.</p>
<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: eh. don’t always count on it.</p>
<p class="samsara">SAMSARA: you might have to start owing me favors.</p>
