<p class="narrator">“Life-bearers are probably some of the most intrinsically motivated people you will meet. While soul-bearers are directed outward, life-bearers naturally focus their own energy onto themselves. As such, when a situation calls for it, they can show extreme persistence and dedication, powering through even the toughest of obstacles. However, with so much attention directed at themselves, they rarely have much reason to reveal themselves to others. People who do not make attempts to intimately know a life-bearer may judge them to be shy at best, and even uncaring or unappreciative of their friendship. Although this judgement is likely wrong, it also results in life-bearers only ever having a few close friends at a time. Get to know a life-bearer, and they are intimate, quirky and determined. But from a distance, they may seem reclusive, socially awkward or unwelcoming.”</p>

<p class="cassiopeia">CASSIOPEIA: you actually blacked out from that?</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Yeah, for a while. She’s been doing that to me for years now. I can recover pretty quickly from it.</p>

<p class="candell">CANDELL: How long was I out for?</p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: A good 3 minutes. We were discussing about you while you were taking a short nap.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: You were??</p>
