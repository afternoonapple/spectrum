<p class="narrator">The aspect of HEAT controls the heat energy within objects, making it colder or hotter. Skilled users of this aspect are even able to conjure fire and/or ice from thin air.</p>
<p class="narrator">“Heat-bearers pride themselves on being competent. For them, a person’s strength comes from within, and it’s not about what you say, but how you say it. With this mentality, almost nothing can stand in their way, and they will try to ensure the quality of everything they do is as perfect as possible. But if or when their superiority complex is broken, it can be quite hard for them to win their confidence back. They firmly believe that any possible fault lies in the being of a person, never their circumstances, and so they tend to beat themselves up on failures and thoroughly reexamine their moral compass after every single one. Heat-bearers will oftentimes be realistic, down-to-earth and always strive to achieve better. However in the pursuit of this reality, they can seem vain, perfectionist or egotistical.”</p>
<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: well i’m not a heat-bearer, sooo</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Heat is only my minor aspect. Anyone a major here?</p>
<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: Me, but I don’t really have much to demonstrate.</p>

<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: I can turn my finger into a lighter, I guess. That’s about it.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: You can’t make it go any bigger?</p>
<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: You’re literally sitting right next to me. Do you <i>want</i> it to be any bigger?</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Hmm. Valid point.</p>
<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: ooh that’s cool tho</p>
<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: can you do the ice part as well?</p>
<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: maybe churn out lil cute ice cubes from your pinky or something?</p>
<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: Heh, no I can’t. I specialised in fire over ice. </p>
<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: Best I can do is cool down my coffee.</p>
