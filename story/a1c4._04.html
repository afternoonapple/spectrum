<p class="narrator">He finishes off his enigmatic remark by throwing his hands upwards. The wall folds inwards, revealing a large, circular machine with pods lining the outside and countless cables on the inside.</p>
<p class="zenith">ZENITH: Well.</p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Okay.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Once I learned of the existence of the 16 of you a few years ago, I started building this machine as a tribute to science.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: To push the limits of biological development into unknown realms.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: And a week and a half ago, I finally finished it.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Yeah that’s cool and all, but what does it do?</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: You know how your power increases with the onset of puberty?</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: The power of the sun allows this machine to boost this potential to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: In fact if all goes well it should double the gains from the different tiers.</p>
<p class="moran">MORAN: tiers?</p>
<p class="cassiopeia">CASSIOPEIA: oh, sorry doctor, we didn’t have enough time to go through the lesson on tiers just now!</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Oh, okay.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Did you at least cover the aspects?</p>
<p class="cassiopeia">CASSIOPEIA: actually, yeah we did.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Well, that’s great.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: You should be familiar with the fact that everyone usually has a distinct major and minor aspect, with some having such a weak minor aspect that they only ever use their major aspect their entire lives. </p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: I, for one, am a light-matter bearer (as you know, the common naming code for bearers is major-minor).</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: But with you 16 kids, the difference in power is so much less. It’s like some of you don’t even have a clear major aspect!</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: That’s why I chose you.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Wow, okay</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: that’s quite creepy but also cool</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: wait. how did you even find the 16 of us??</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: That’s a pretty good question.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: I have magic assessment records from elementary and middle schools across the country.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Through the years I tracked down 16 suitable candidates for this groundbreaking program.</p>
<p class="zenith">ZENITH: Wait, so this has been in the works for years?? </p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Well, yeah.</p>
<p class="zenith">ZENITH: But for what?</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: We’ll get to that later.</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: What about the tiers?</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: What are those</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Ah, the tiers. They’re easier to explain.</p>
