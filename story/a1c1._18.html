<p class="narrator">A notably awkward silence would have ensued if not for the jarring noise of the school bell followed by another message from the notice board.</p>
<p class="announcement"><u>Break time. Assemble back here in your classroom in 1 hour.</u></p>
<p class="kranyon">KRANYON: Oh great. </p>
<p class="atom">ATOM: See you guys in an hour, I’m off to check out the food.</p>
<p class="tenebris">TENEBRIS: ok well bye guys! catch ya later</p>
<p class="narrator">They silently leave, full of new refreshing thoughts. Well, except for Candell and Fenferra who immediately start talking the moment they pass the classroom door on the way out. Nexus notices Nefferin still gathering his things, and takes the chance to talk.</p>

<p class="nexus">NEXUS: hi! you’re…</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: oh what am i doing i can read your thoughts</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: oh right you can</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: well</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: the interesting thing about you is</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: you’re the only person whose mind i actually didn’t manage to get far enough inside to reveal to me that you had special powers</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: how long did all of that take, exactly</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: well i’d say i concentrated for about half a second per person</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: wow nexus, that was exceedingly long.</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: it almost seems like youre not as powerful as you thought.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: oh, shut.</p>
<p class="narrator">She jabs him quickly in the torso with a generously added crackle of psychic energy. He recoils significantly.</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: jeez what was <i>that??</i></p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: oh you know, just a little of my psychic shenanigans.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: we have 4 years man. you’re trapped here with me heheheh</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: oh boy</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: anyway i dont think i have an explanation for you exactly. as to why that happened</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: well i can’t read your thoughts if you aren’t sure of them</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: and you can’t be sure of your thoughts when you aren’t sure of yourself</p>
<p class="narrator">Nexus slowly holds out a hand for a handshake. Nefferin looks at the hand hesitatingly.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: so i hope whatever it is you got on man, you have it sorted out</p>
<p class="narrator">Nefferin accepts the handshake, the slightest smile on his face.</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: thanks</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: maybe im just confused as to what i wanna do.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: hmm, maybe you are.</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: like, its high school you know? so many possibilities now.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: well we’ll always be here to help</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: heh ok</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: anyway there’s a lot about psychic stuff you probably still don’t know</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: maybe i’ll find the patience to tell you what i know someday</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: what do you mean</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: by willingly offering a point of physical contact i broke quite easily into your mind</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: now i see your headspace clear and thorough</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: wait so i got scammed</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: i personally wouldn't call it that, but… </p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: wow well played</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: ive been fooled</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: took the bait straight in the face</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: you mean you didn’t notice it? at all? when i set the connection up</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: pretty much nothing. am i supposed to feel something?</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: if you’re sharp enough. wow, your mind is. really something. </p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: resistant out, yet vulnerable in.</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: what can i say, the inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: you’re funny, blueblood.</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: heh</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: well its been nice talking to you. zenith is down the corridor mind-pestering me to go check out the food here.</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: it’s been nice talking to you too</p>
<p class="nexus">NEXUS: see you later, nefferin!</p>
<p class="nefferin">NEFFERIN: cya</p>
