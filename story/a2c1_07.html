	<p class="moran">MORAN: uh.</p>
	<p class="moran">MORAN: anyway, he went off to check the facilities in the lab about like half an hour ago</p>
	<p class="moran">MORAN: what’s the status arwen?</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: All out of electricity.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: The collapse of the building probably cut the lab’s access to the power grid.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: The circuits in the equipment dealing with magic were completely fried.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: The machine likely released a massive wave of magic energy into the building and who knows for how much further after that.</p>
	<p class="atom">ATOM: So then we can’t get back to school by the teleporter.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Yeah, we’re gonna be stuck here for days until we can re-establish power.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Actually, probably at least a week.</p>
	<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: Oh no, that’s not good.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: It could be, actually.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: I found a few empty spare rooms in the lab, a kitchen area and a bulk pack of 20 sleeping bags.</p>	
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: So there’s plenty of space for everyone.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: They also have those cool garden growth things where you can get pretty much any crop you want in a couple of hours.</p>
	<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: Ooh, so we get to cook whatever we want to eat?</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: I guess.</p>
	<p class="moran">MORAN: wait, you’re saying we live here?</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Well, uh…</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Actually it’s entirely possible.</p>
	<p class="atom">ATOM: I really don’t mind.</p>
	<p class="atom">ATOM: Although, don’t you think we should wait for the others to wake up first, then make a decision?</p>
	<p class="moran">MORAN: yeah we probably should</p>
	<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: Then what should we do now?</p>
	<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: The best course of action is to just wait, then.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Maybe that’s what we should do.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Oh yeah by the way, anyone saw Aurora?</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: The blue girl.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Her pod door was left slightly ajar, and when I peered closely through the one way glass there was no one.</p>
	<p class="moran">MORAN: you mean she’s just gone??</p>
	<p class="moran">MORAN: we should definitely look for her once we have enough people.</p>
	<p class="atom">ATOM: In the meantime…</p>
	<p class="atom">ATOM: Guess we’ll just wait.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="narrator">And waiting was exactly what they did.</p>
