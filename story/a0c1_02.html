    [ENTER Two friends take the subway station. (names will be hidden with the ?? marks and revealed at the end)]
==>
(img: seeing each other)
FENFERRA: Dell, wait up!
==>
(img: talk)
FENFERRA: Hey.
CANDELL: Oh, hello neighbour.
FENFERRA: Where ya going?
CANDELL: Today’s my first day in high school.
CANDELL: I’m just heading to North-17 for the subway. 
FENFERRA: Oooh same here!
FENFERRA: I’m in Sequoia High School. Class 1-S!
CANDELL: Oh. Me too. 
CANDELL: Hahah, elementary, middle AND now same high school? That’s gotta be pushing the luck meter.
FENFERRA: Well we won’t complain about it, will we?
FENFERRA: Anyways I’m kinda looking forward to it! New class means new people to be friends with!
CANDELL: That’s not really the only point though, we’re there mainly to study.
FENFERRA: Oh stop being a grouch. Learning in high school doesn’t mean being unable to chit-chat along the way!!
CANDELL: Oh no no. I meant the learning will stop us from having too much fun.
FENFERRA: Suuuure you do. 
FENFERRA: Admit it Dell, you don’t like making new friends.
CANDELL: Ferr you’re really the only one who knows me inside out.
CANDELL: Whatever would I be able to socially accomplish without you.
FENFERRA: Was that sincere or sarcastic? I still can’t tell with you.
CANDELL: Sarcastically sincere sounds like a good way to describe it.
FENFERRA: Ugh that’s not how complimenting someone works!!
FENFERRA: If you’re honest and sincerely complimenting, you’ve gotta at least sound the part.
CANDELL: Honestly and sincerely, you’re really the only one who knows me inside out.
FENFERRA: There we go, that’s better.
FENFERRA: Truly, whatever would you be able to socially accomplish without me.
CANDELL: Wow. Ouch.
FENFERRA: I’m sorry.
CANDELL: It’s fine, I was being sarcastic that time.
FENFERRA: It’s fine, me too :)
==>
CANDELL: What do you think they’ll be like?
FENFERRA: What?
CANDELL: Our new classmates.
FENFERRA: I’m sure they’ll be just fine!
CANDELL: What would you do if they’re mean?
FENFERRA: 
==>
[ENTER school gates]
FENFERRA: Well we’re here. Just on time too.
FENFERRA: Wait. Where’s our classroom?
FENFERRA: This place is massive!
CANDELL: No worries, I have a map on my phone.
CANDELL: Downloaded beforehand, of course.
FENFERRA: Wow, you’re real handy. Always know to count on you for directions!
CANDELL: Thanks.
CANDELL: Oh, it’s this way. Up three floors and down some long-ass corridor.
CANDELL: Should be the 4th or 5th room.
FENFERRA: Nice job. We’ll be there in no time!
CANDELL: A new set of opportunities. That’s what awaits us through that classroom door.
FENFERRA: A new set of buddies. That’s what awaits us!
CANDELL: You’ll advise me, won’t you?
CANDELL: Making friends with these guys. Truly an art I will never master.
FENFERRA: What kind of a question is that?
FENFERRA: ‘Advise’ you?
FENFERRA: Buddy, I’ll be there every step of the way.
FENFERRA: After all, you’re my best friend.
CANDELL: Hahah. 
CANDELL: Thanks, Fenferra.
(reveal)
FENFERRA: Let’s do our best, Candell!
CANDELL: I’ll be with you.

Meanwhile… ==>
[ENTER Abigaile and Nefferin walk to the school. (names will be hidden with the ?? marks)]
ABIGAILE: whats up, cross-eye.
NEFFERIN: oh, its you.
NEFFERIN: from the dorm
ABIGAILE: yeah, ive seen you around at silas before.
ABIGAILE: block gamma, third floor. we never really talked much.
NEFFERIN: us gammas are the coolest.
ABIGAILE: heck yeah.

NEFFERIN: could you please not call me that outside of silas
NEFFERIN: people wont get the dorm joke anyway
ABIGAILE: ehh whatever.
ABIGAILE: cmon, the school is two blocks from here.
ABIGAILE: classes start in 20 minutes cross-eye, time is ticking away!
NEFFERIN: can i ask you a favour?
ABIGAILE: to call you cross-eye practically all the time?
NEFFERIN: heh. over my dead body.
ABIGAILE: seriously though, you move pretty slowly.
ABIGAILE: gotta pick up the pace man.
NEFFERIN: alright alright, ill walk faster howl cub
ABIGAILE: im sorry, what did you just call me?
NEFFERIN: im sorry, did you just prefer not to be called by your dorm nickname?
ABIGAILE: psshh. fine, i concede. 
NEFFERIN: hah
ABIGAILE: its only my closer friends. most people dont even call me that at all!
ABIGAILE: dork.
==>
NEFFERIN: oh hey do i see another familiar face
ABIGAILE: where?
NEFFERIN: look, on the other side of the road.
NEFFERIN: ive seen her around on silas grounds too
ABIGAILE: oh yeah! forgot her name though.
ABIGAILE: i think it was calsie or something.
ABIGAILE: you think shes going to sequoia like us?
NEFFERIN: well i hope she does
ABIGAILE: hm oh really? 
ABIGAILE: do i sense something goin on?
NEFFERIN: what no you dont
She snickers.
ABIGAILE: anyway shes probably from epsilon, theres no way youd know her well.
NEFFERIN: exactly, i dont.
NEFFERIN: but new connections are always good i guess
ABIGAILE: man, who are you kidding. you dont show up for at least half the dorm dinners.
NEFFERIN: hmmmm.
As they turn round the corner of the block, the school gate stands before them.
ABIGAILE: oh look, were already here.
ABIGAILE: guess its time to part ways.
NEFFERIN: relax, well see each other around the campus sometime
NEFFERIN: looks like a pretty big place but as they say its a small world
ABIGAILE: heh. catch you later then.
ABIGAILE: nefferin.
(reveal names now)
NEFFERIN: likewise, abigaile
ABIGAILE: bye!

Inside one of the classrooms… ==>
(names hidden)
MORAN enters the classroom. ARWEN is already inside.
MORAN: wait.
MORAN: yooo you’re here!
ARWEN: Hey hey, what’s up!
The two boys do a sequence of well-rehearsed handshakes.
ARWEN: You’re finally here. Class starts in six minutes, Moran.[reveal] A bit unlike you to be this tardy, isn’t it?
MORAN: nice to meet you too, arwen.[reveal]
MORAN: you would not believe how much trouble i had getting here, the size of this place is unbelievable.
MORAN: how did you find your way here so quickly?
ARWEN: A map of the school exists, you know.
MORAN: you can look at that thing??
ARWEN: I’ve seen apparatus schematics twice as hard to decipher. I’m already used to it.
MORAN: nice.
MORAN: here, there’s a seating arrangement on the wall. we sit together.
ARWEN: Unfortunately for me.
MORAN: unfortunately for you indeed.
He puts his bag on the floor.
MORAN: hmm, i didn’t even know you came to sequoia high.
ARWEN: Huh? Didn’t I send you a Talgram text the evening the school allocations came out?
MORAN: oh my god. you know i never check my talgram account.
ARWEN: Man, you never check your socials. That’s why you don’t have any friends.
MORAN: well it takes one to know one
ARWEN: Fool. At least I read messages.

Suddenly… ==>
A girl bursts through the open classroom door with unnatural speed. She is short, wearing a miniskirt and a shirt with a two-piece design that manages to cover her arms twice but reveal a little of her torso. Probably not the most optimal attire to run in.
ARWEN: Dang, look at her.
MORAN: please, the day hasn’t even begun yet. curb your enthusiasm.
GALINDA[hidden] takes a few moments to regain her composure (unsuccessfully) and walks right over next to Moran as per the seating arrangement dictates.
MORAN: oh, you’re the number 8.
MORAN: galinda, did i pronounce that correctly?
GALINDA: *huff* Not perfectly, but thats perfectly fine
GALINDA: Seems like the three of us are seated here together
GALINDA: Greenblood buddies, eh?
MORAN: greenblood buddies it is.
GALINDA: Eyyy.
ARWEN: You look like you had trouble getting here?
GALINDA: Not really, there were a bunch of clues and signs everywhere I could follow
MORAN:(what.)
GALINDA: I was so scared I was gonna be late! I overslept.
ARWEN: Yikes. Well at least you found where you needed to go.
GALINDA: Right
GALINDA: Has class started yet? 
ARWEN: I don’t think so. The computer is on standby mode right now.
MORAN: yeah, the 12 of us were just vibing in the classroom
MORAN: 13 with you now, actually.
GALINDA: Thats great! Vibing is definitely something right up my alley
MORAN: hmm, that’s cool. maybe you want to do some self-introduction for us?
MORAN: no pressure given.
GALINDA: Dont worry, no pressure received
She looks as if she is on the verge of standing up and delivering an impromptu speech.
GALINDA: Right. As you know, my names Galinda
GALINDA: As far as personality goes, Id like to think of myself as an Entertainer
MORAN: wait, you know about the myers-briggs type indicator system?
GALINDA: Hm? Whats that?
MORAN: mbti.
GALINDA: Oooh, yeah I do! Finally someone else who does
MORAN: niiice
GALINDA: I love talking to people, making new friends! Definitely wanna get to know you two, and everyone else here
GALINDA: And todays only the beginning! Well be here for the next 4 yea-
At that instant, the chime of a school bell is heard. The computer and the connected screen immediately begins to start up, which means they won’t be able to talk for much longer.
GALINDA: -oh welp.
GALINDA: Guess thats it, haha
ARWEN: Well looks like we’ve gotta cut our intros short too.
ARWEN: I’m Arwen and he’s Moran. 
MORAN: pleased to meet you
GALINDA: Same
GALINDA: Great to get to know you two. Well talk more later, I guess?
ARWEN: When we get the chances.
ARWEN: We’re sitting together for at least this whole semester, anyway. There’ll be many.
GALINDA: Sure thing, Arwen
GALINDA: Man Im so excited to start this thing. Lets all have some fun!
And with that, the now-familiar sound of the classroom computer finishing its boot process plays over the integrated speaker. The clock reads exactly 8.30am, Monday, September 6 2793. The internal fans start their quiet humming, and the display switches on with a flicker of static, then pure white light.
It’s time to begin.
