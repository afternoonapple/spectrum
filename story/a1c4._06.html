<p class="narrator">Doctor Brown hands them the earpieces, and a teleporter backpack to take them back to the lab afterwards. He leads them into a separate room.</p>
<p class="atom">ATOM: Even more teleporters?</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Well yes. I did say we were going pretty far away.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Come now, children. Each of the teleporters has lights corresponding to your blood colour.</p>
<p class="adelphi">ADELPHI: Hey, this isn’t exactly my blood colour.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Sharp eye! The glass tints the lights underneath so the colours appear a little more desaturated.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Wait, whose brilliant idea was it to put RGB lights in a teleporter pad?</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Heh I don’t know, I don’t manufacture these.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Some consumers probably value the precision of the colour-coding-</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Oh wait, hold on.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Agh, damn these machines.</p>
<p class="arwen">ARWEN: What’s wrong, Doc?</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: The teleporters didn't charge. Wow.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Wow.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Man, it's the main circuit.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: (How did the T-flip-flop switch there??)</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: I swear, this has never happened before. Must've been a fault from this morning, I checked yesterday and everything was working. </p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Soooo, are we still going on a trip? </p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: They’ll take half a day to charge. Probably not. </p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Awww</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Alright, you’ll have to come back tomorrow or Wednesday to try and retrieve these weapons.</p>
<p class="galinda">GALINDA: Wait, weapons??</p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: Woah really?? </p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Yes, weapons. The plan was to get them before you were powered up, so you could head back home after your first day and immediately start testing your techniques for your school combat tests.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Okay, but there are exactly sixteen of them?</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: And why do we have to go all the way there? Our current weapons work fine as they are now.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: You guys have to go there to retrieve them, because no one has been able to for the past 9 hundred years.</p>
