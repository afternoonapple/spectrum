	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Uhh, actually it’s quite complicated. You can read up on your own if you want to.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="narrator">The kids just nod, intrigued by what lies ahead of them. Some of them are excited that they were more special than they had thought. Others are excited about how much the machine would help them.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Anyway, I wanted to test something else.</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Everyone, put on these earpieces. We’re going somewhere far far away.</p>
	<p class="narrator">Okay, the jig is up. Their ancestors were used for the illustrations.</p>
	<p class="arwen">ARWEN: Where are we going exactly?</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Some old places.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="narrator">Doctor Brown hands them the earpieces, and a teleporting backpack to take them back to the lab afterwards. He leads them to 16 small teleport pads, colour coded for their blood (which is their text colour). All sixteen of the kids are whisked away to remote shrines, with weapons set in stones, in every single shrine. </p>
	<br>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Can you all hear me?</p>
	<p class="narrator">The kids all reply ‘yes’.</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: See those weapons over there?</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: They are centuries old, and possibly belonged to your ancestors.</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Not your parents, but parallels who were like you, and they grew up and lived their different lives.</p>
	<p class="narrator">Okay, the jig is up. The kids' ancestors were used for the illustrations.</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: The whole story is rather interesting, I should tell it to you all someday.</p>
	<p class="narrator">Rest assured, you'll find out in due time.</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: The point is, all 16 of those weapons are forged out from an unbreakable magical stone, from which it is embedded in now.</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: No one has ever been able to break or pull out those weapons ever since they were put there.</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: I’ll need you to put your hands around whichever handles you see, and on the count of three…</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: 1,</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: 2,</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: 3…</p>
	<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Pull!</p>
