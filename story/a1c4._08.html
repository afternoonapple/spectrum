<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Well, sorry for hyping you kids up so much. You’ll have to wait a little while longer.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: The original plan was to attempt to get those weapons right now. If you succeeded, they would be yours to keep, I guess.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: They’ll be very useful in your school combat assessments, being almost unbreakable.</p>
<p class="narrator">A smile lights up all 16 of their faces. It’s everything they wanted in a new weapon, and possibly more than that. </p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Alright then, let’s get down to business.</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: How long will this process take to complete, may I ask</p>
<p class="onnyx">ONNYX: I tend to get pins and needles if I stand somewhere for too long</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: No worries. It will probably only take about a minute and a half.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Regardless, the pod is very well ventilated with oxygen in case your bodies are unable to cope with the sudden transition.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: We might pass out??</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: Well, barring unforeseen circumstances, no.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: But there may be surges from the sun’s power from time to time.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: You should be up after an hour at most.</p>
<p class="fenferra">FENFERRA: That sounds a little dangerous.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: My team and I have been monitoring the sun’s activity since last month. I assure you that there have been no significant anomalies these few years, either.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: In fact, if I can remember correctly, the last problematic solar flare occurred on this day exactly 15 years ago. A funny coincidence.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: But yes, it does carry some risk. We have passed many legal and technological hurdles to get to this point.</p>
<p class="drbrown">DR. BROWN: But, I am sure you will all be very impressed with the results when all goes according to plan.</p>
<p class="candell">CANDELL: Heh, well then sign me up.</p>

<p class="narrator">The kids return back to the main chamber, and get into the pods while the machine gradually initializes. </p>
<p class="narrator">The machine where they leave their old world behind.</p>
<p class="narrator">The machine where their new selves are made. Forged from the very power of the sun.</p>
<p class="narrator">The machine where they gain not only their ultimate freedom, but also their ultimate responsibility.</p>
