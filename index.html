	<p class="narrator" style="line-height:1.15">Happy Christmas Eve Eve! If you're reading this, that means my 6 hours and 21 minutes of working on website maintenance has finally come to pass. If you've been around here before, you'll now notice that there are navigation links on each and every page of the story, as well as an About and Log section to track our progress for the coming acts. I plan on adding a Music and Art section (hopefully) in the future too. Neat! As of the time of writing, we're currently halfway into A2C2+. The pace has been moving slowly to sort out plot in Acts 4 and 5, and I promise it'll be worth it eventually. Right now, I actually plan on revamping the whole of Act I (none of the plot points will be changed, but overall the writing is still kind of a cringy mess.) So expect a technical hiatus once we complete the other half of A2C2+, because we'll be revisiting the earlier parts of the story to, you know, flesh it out much more than initially planned. As it is, you'd probably have trouble remembering our 16 main characters. Well, enjoy the website update and see you soon! Stuff is in the works.</p>
