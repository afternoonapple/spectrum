	<p class="narrator" style="line-height:1.15">Happy day after Christmas... Christmas Anti-Eve?? If you're reading this, then I've actually gone and revamped the whole of Act I and drew all the panels with a new art style. Not only that, I've released it to my friends to read for the first time. A lot of courage went into this decision and perhaps some of them will never see me the same way again, but I believe it has finally been long enough for me to share this story with a wider audience. I recommend everyone who's gone on to Act II still to reread Act I, it may help you to recall the characters better. Not only that, the word count has been more than doubled, with 7k words on the old Act I and 16k words on the new one. There's a ton of new worldbuilding, lore and tidbits of info on how exactly society works in the year 2793. The characters of the 4 extras have also been fleshed out, but their fate remains to be seen after the end of Act I (hmmmm.) Guess you'll have to wait to find out. Anyway, this is likely the last Spectrum update in 2021, and maybe even the whole of January 2022. I will take a break to sort things out moving forward, but I will go back to working on that fabled second half of A2C2+ that I teased in the newspost below over a year ago and still haven't drawn panels for yet. As always, enjoy the update and have fun reading the much chonkier Act I, and see you soon. Stuff is in the works.</p>
	<p class="narrator" style="line-height:1.15"><span style="color:#ffff00">[23/12/20]</span> First newspost! <i>[Website Improvements, About the Hiatus, Rewriting Act I]</i></p>
	<p class="narrator" style="line-height:1.15">Happy Christmas Eve Eve! If you're reading this, that means my 6 hours and 21 minutes of working on website maintenance has finally come to pass. If you've been around here before, you'll now notice that there are navigation links on each and every page of the story, as well as an About and Log section to track our progress for the coming acts. I plan on adding a Music and Art section (hopefully) in the future too. Neat! As of the time of writing, we're currently halfway into A2C2+. The pace has been moving slowly to sort out plot in Acts 4 and 5, and I promise it'll be worth it eventually. Right now, I actually plan on revamping the whole of Act I (none of the plot points will be changed, but overall the writing is still kind of a cringy mess.) So expect a technical hiatus once we complete the other half of A2C2+, because we'll be revisiting the earlier parts of the story to, you know, flesh it out much more than initially planned. As it is, you'd probably have trouble remembering our 16 main characters. Well, enjoy the website update and see you soon! Stuff is in the works.</p>
